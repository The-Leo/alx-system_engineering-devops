# 0x0C. Web server

The main role of a web server is to handle incoming requests from clients (typically web browsers) and serve web content to them. 

Web Servers do the following:

* Request Handling
* Routing
* Resource Retrieval
* Processing
* Response Generation
* Transmission
* Error Handling
* Security
* Load Balancing
* Logging and Monitoring
* Caching

In this project, I learned how web servers work and began using one. I was provided a personal server by Holberton School. I learned how to use scp and Fabric to transfer files to my server. Additionally, I completed a basic configuration of the server using Nginx.
