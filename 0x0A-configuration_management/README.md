# 0x0A. Configuration management

Configuration management (CM) refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time. Even though this process was not originated in the IT industry, the term is broadly used to refer to server configuration management.

## Some benefits of configuration management are as follows: 

* Quick Provisioning of New Servers
* Quick Recovery from Critical Events
* No More Snowflake Servers
* Version Control for the Server Environment
* Replicated Environments


In this project, I started working with Puppet as a configuration management tool. I practiced writing Puppet manifest files to create a file, install a package, and execute a command.
